**📌 Key Insights & Visualizations**

---

**📈 1. Average Price by Category**  
Some categories like **Electronics** and **Appliances** show significantly higher average prices than others, which aligns with customer expectations for high-value items.

---

**💰 2. Discount vs Rating Correlation**  
There’s **no strong correlation** between discounts and product ratings, implying that offering discounts doesn't necessarily increase customer satisfaction.

---

**⭐ 3. Rating Distribution**  
Most products cluster around ratings of **4.0–4.5**, indicating overall positive customer feedback. Few products have ratings below **3.0**.

---

**🏆 4. Top-Rated Products**  
These are some of the **highest-rated products**, sorted by rating and number of reviews. They can serve as **benchmarks for quality and popularity**.

---

**🛍️ 5. Top-Selling Categories**  
Categories like **Electronics**, **Clothing**, and **Home** consistently dominate Amazon sales, highlighting high consumer demand.

---

**✅ Conclusion**

This analysis reveals valuable insights into **consumer behavior**, **pricing patterns**, and **product popularity**. The lack of correlation between discounts and ratings suggests that **value and quality outweigh discounts** in the eyes of customers.
